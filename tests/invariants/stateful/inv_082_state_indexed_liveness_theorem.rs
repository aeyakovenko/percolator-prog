//! INV-082 - State-indexed liveness theorem.
//!
//! Normative obligation: every publicly reachable nonterminal state in each
//! lifecycle mode either is terminal already or has a constructible bounded
//! public action that decreases the mode-specific rank.
//!
//! Evidence in this file (F/I over public routes): the shared stateful model
//! drives a fixed public sequence that covers all trade routes, account
//! substitution rejection, mark movement, and complete-hint cranks. Its
//! permissionless-progress campaign recomputes the deployed state rank before
//! and after every successful public crank, and fails if every actionable
//! public candidate rejects or does not decrease rank. The follow-on exit
//! campaign then proves normal users can leave through public routes. This is a
//! bounded whole-route witness, not an exhaustive proof over every reachable
//! state.
