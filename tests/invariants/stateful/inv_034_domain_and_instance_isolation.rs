//! INV-034 - Domain and instance isolation.

//! Normative obligation: Value and liabilities cannot cross market instances or source domains without an explicit rule.
//!
//! Evidence in this file (F over public I routes): `v16_program_pr290_cross_margin_insurance_drain_fuzz`. These tests exercise the deployed public
//! wrapper with real SBF/LiteSVM account construction and assert economic state, token,
//! rollback, liveness, or compute outcomes appropriate to the invariant.
//!
//! Guarantee boundary: a quarantined counterexample demonstrates public reachability; it does
//! not certify the invariant on an unfixed pin. Certification requires the fixed-pin assertion
//! plus every additional verification method required by the charter.
